# CMPE256 Project

1.1 Motivation:
 
We choose this dataset from the suggested Machine Learning Datasets provided in Canvas. We are motivated to work on DonorsChoose.org dataset because it is a live competition and good dataset for beginners to work on applying basics of machine learning concepts which we learnt as part of the course. Also, we believed that working on this competition can lead to habituate in solving live competitions.
 
The problem we focused on the selected dataset is to automate the application screening process where the organization gets more than 500,000 requests at any given point of time. Currently many volunteers are working on screening the applications manually which is equivalent to thousands of man hours. Organization believed that this manual process can be automated through machine learning algorithms to auto-approve at least some applications without taking much time. Such that the same volunteers can devote their time in other detailed process.
 
1.2 Objective:
 
Our objective is to work on predicting whether a given project application can be approved or not based on the information provided. Also, to implement efficient algorithms for training the model for better prediction with the help of standard evaluation techniques.
